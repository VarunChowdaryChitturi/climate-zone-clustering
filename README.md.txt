# 🌍 Climate Zone Clustering & Extreme Weather Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify 100K+ global weather records into meaningful climate zones and detect extreme weather anomalies using statistical methods.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Feature Selection
- Z-score Standardization
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method (WSS)
- Hierarchical Clustering (Ward’s Method)
- PCA for Visualization
- Z-score Based Anomaly Detection

## 📈 Key Results
- Identified 4 meaningful climate clusters
- Segmented cities based on temperature, humidity, wind, pollution, and UV index
- Detected extreme cold waves, rainfall spikes, and pollution anomalies

## 🛠 Tools
R, tidyverse, cluster, factoextra

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required R packages
2. Place dataset in project folder
3. Run climate_project.R
